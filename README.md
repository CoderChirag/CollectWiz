CollectWiz is the complete frontend implementation of a web app to store the files and folders on cloud. We have built our own **custom File System** using the **Tree Data Structure.**
<br></br>

User can easily create files and folders, browse through different folders and files, delete the files and folders and rename them. Browsing through folders is enabled by **custom dynamic routing.** Later on, by building a backend we would also enable the upload of real files and hence connecting it to cloud.
<br></br>

The main attraction of the project, is the architecture of the code. The project architecture, file and folder structure, and the naming conventions closely resembles to that of any real industry project. It is built keeping in mind the famous **Atomic Design** architecture. The project achieves a great level of **Abstraction** and **Encapsulation** by separating each functionality into separate files and modules. The code is completely modular and very easy to read and edit.
